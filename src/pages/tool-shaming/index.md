Most of us have heard it at some point. "WHAT? You use X framework/tool/OS/language?! So... you're a bad developer then?"

I did not come from a Software Development background into this industry. I was an outsider, but it's what I wanted to do my whole life. This is my story: how I refocused and retrained in my career to be confronted with a nightmare of gatekeeping, elistism and 
aggression. I saw what I thought was a problem, and I'd like to propose a solution.

What we do is hard. We're in a young industry full of contradictions and opinions, and sometimes it excludes people, it shapes new developers' attitudes poorly and it causes people to walk away. In this talk I'll focus on what I've experienced, what others have experienced, what is harmful to your business with this culture and what can be done about it.

PS. I don't care about emacs or vim. Can you ship it?
