# James Seconde - The Dev Theatre

#### I'm a developer advocate in infinite training. Watch me learn and build stuff.

This is forked from Ryan Fitzgerald's excellent Gatsby blog template.
It's deployed by Netlify, and will eventually contain a couple of modified features such as a React menu and videos page.
