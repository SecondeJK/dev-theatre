### This is a scaffold static site in Gatsby.js

#### It's a work in progress, so what it will encompass is

2. Integration with Semantic UI for styling
3. Query filter by Month
4. Search function
5. Netlify deploy hooks.

#### I'm a developer advocate in infinite training. Watch me learn and build stuff.
